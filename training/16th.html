<p style="line-height: 25px; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 20px;">Organizational culture is a system of shared assumptions, values, and beliefs, which governs how people behave in organizations. These shared values have a strong
influence on the people in the organization and dictate how they dress, act, and perform their jobs. Every organization develops and maintains a unique culture, which
provides guidelines and boundaries for the behaviour of the members of the organization.</br></br>
In the class different Organization culture will be discussed and comparison will be demonstrated for different companies from different countries.</p>
