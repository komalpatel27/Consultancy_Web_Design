<h1>Campus Placement Services</h1>

  <br></br>
  <div class="container">
  <p>The major objective of campus placement is to identify the talented and qualified professionals before they complete their education. This process reduces the time for an
industry to pick the candidates according to their need. It is a cumbersome activity and hence majority of the companies find it difficult to trace the right talent. Many students
do not understand the importance of placement training that is being imparted, whether it is an aptitude training or soft skills. They show the least interest in this due to various
factors viz., projects, assignments or more of activities loaded by the colleges as part of their curriculum thinking that it is not useful. It is the responsibility of the companies
training on placement to make the students equipped on all aspects of career development along with creating a very good impact in them which makes them feel every
minute they spend in the placement training session is worth being there and will help them in getting placed in their dream companies.</P><br></br>
