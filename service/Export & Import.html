   <h1>Export & Import</h1>
</header>
<h1></h1>

<p>The term export means shipping in the goods and services out of the jurisdiction of a country. The seller of such goods and services is referred to as an "exporter" and is
based in the country of export whereas the overseas based buyer is referred to as an "importer". In international trade, "exports" refers to selling goods and services produced
in the home country to other markets.</p>

<p>Export of commercial quantities of goods normally requires involvement of the customs authorities in both the country of export and the country of import. The advent of small
trades over the internet such as through Amazon and eBay have largely bypassed the involvement of Customs in many countries because of the low individual values of
these trades. Nonetheless, these small exports are still subject to legal restrictions applied by the country of export. An export's counterpart is an import.</p>

<p>An import is a good brought into a jurisdiction, especially across a national border, from an external source. The party bringing in the good is called an importer. An import in
the receiving country is an export from the sending country. Importation and exportation are the defining financial transactions of international trade.</p>

<p>In international trade, the importation and exportation of goods are limited by import quotas and mandates from the customs authority. The importing and exporting
jurisdictions may impose a tariff (tax) on the goods. In addition, the importation and exportation of goods are subject to trade agreements between the importing and exporting
jurisdictions.</p>

of Indian Economy. Various big and small companies have ventured into this sector.</p>
