<p>An internship is a system of on-the-job training for white-collar and professional careers. Internships for professional careers are similar to apprenticeships for trade and
vocational jobs. Although interns are typically college or university students, they can also be high school students or post-graduate adults. On occasion, they are middle
school or even elementary students. In some countries, internships for school children are called work experience.</p>

<P>Generally, an internship consists of an exchange of services for experience between the student and his or her employer. Students can also use an internship to determine if
they have an interest in a particular career, create a network of contacts, or gain school credit. Some interns also find permanent, paid employment with the companies in
which they interned. Thus, employers also benefit as experienced interns need little or no training when they begin full-time regular employment.</p>
