   <h1>Heat Ventilation & Air Conditioning</h1>
</header>
<h1></h1>

<p>When thinking about energy efficiency, one of the most important decisions to be made regarding a new home is the type of heating and cooling system to install. Equally
critical to consider is the selection of the heating and cooling contractor. The operating efficiency of a system depends as much on proper installation as it does on the
performance rating of the equipment. Improper design and improper installation of the HVAC system have negative impacts on personal comfort and on energy bills. Improper
design and installation of a HVAC system can dramatically degrade the quality of air in a home. Poorly designed and poorly installed ducts can create dangerous conditions
that may reduce comfort, degrade indoor air quality, or even threaten the health of the people.</p>

<p>Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A.C., or A/C) is the process of removing heat from a confined space, thus cooling the air, and removing humidity. Air conditioning
can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans or animals;
however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and even to display
and store artwork.</p>

<p>Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Electric
refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers
that can cool an entire building. The cooling is typically achieved through a refrigeration cycle, but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used. Air conditioning systems can
also be made based on desiccants (chemicals which remove moisture from the air) and subterraneous pipes that can distribute the heated refrigerant to the ground for
cooling.[1] In the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air (heating, cooling, (de-)humidification, cleaning,
ventilation, or air movement). In common usage, though, "air conditioning" refers to systems which cool air. In construction, a complete system of heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning is referred to as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC â€“ as opposed to AC).</p>

<p>Now a days almost all the office places required Air Conditioning and this segments required lots of skilled manpower in different levels. The requirement of AC drastically
increased due to environmental pollution and increase of average heating level of environment.</p>
