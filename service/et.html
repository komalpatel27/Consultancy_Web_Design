In today’s India, the old behemoths and educational warhorses have a fight on their hands. For new educational institutions to flourish and market themselves as attractive destinations for learning and also for the old educational powerhouses to fight for their position in a changing economic and social model, recruitment of leading talent becomes a critical factor in success.
