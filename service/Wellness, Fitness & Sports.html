First things first, the health and fitness industry in India is poised at an inflection point, with high market fragmentation, stupendous market potential and end-to-end overall growth. Several new business models are emerging to disrupt this industry. The fitness and wellness sector in India has come a long way from the days of the local ‘akhadas’ to wrestling now being a part of the international Olympics, with India actively taking part in it and winning medals for the country. Bodybuilding and power lifting championships are other such examples. Since prehistoric times, mankind’s tryst with fitness was driven by the will to survive and this he did, through hunting.

Festivals and social occasions made people travel huge distances and perform for hours together, which in turn required exceptionally higher levels of stamina and strength. Then occurred agriculture and farming and after that, men were trained extensively to become fit soldiers. Today fitness industry in India, is chiefly driven towards heath, well-being, good looks and confidence. Resistance training, aerobics, Zumba, aerial yoga, Pilates, MMA, kickboxing etc. have become the fitness trends over a few years in India.

More recently, it has been witnessed that many mom-and-pop structures are making way for organized retailing in the gym business and the trend will only accelerate in the coming times, with the entry of global players, home grown start ups as well as online marketplace business models, structured around the gyms and fitness domainsnot only fitness services, but also products.
