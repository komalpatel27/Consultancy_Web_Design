<h1>Temporary Staffing Solution </h1>
  </div>
  <br></br>
  <div class="container">
<p>Across the country, organisations big and small are struggling to deal with increased government regulations and volatile market demand. When things are uncertain, you may
not want to hire permanent employees on a full-time basis. You want the flexibility of an agile, on-demand workforce who is equipped to run your business operations just the
way you want them to.</P>

<p>Seven Consultancy Consulting provides reliable temporary staffing solutions that offer you the ability to build your staff strength without absorbing them full time, assist
overloaded employees during critical times, and keep projects moving. We are one of the leading employee leasing services in India, offering a full service, cost-effective, and
efficient Human Resource Management services to organisations that may not have the necessary infrastructure or inclination to perform these labour-intensive tasks. When
you hire us as your temporary staffing agency, we would work just like your company's own HR Department, minus the hassles and tediousness that you’d otherwise have to
deal with.</p>

<h2>WE RECRUIT FOR YOUR NEEDS</h2><br></br>

<p>We have a proven, time-tested recruitment process which allows us to recruit just the right candidates for your company. We have professional networks all over the country
which give us access to a huge base of candidates. We vigorously screen, shortlist, and evaluate potential candidates to give you the choicest picks.</P>

<h3>DECREASE YOUR COSTS</h3><br></br>

<p>Our temporary staffing services will allow your company to staff up or down depending on the needs of your current business cycle. Temporary staffing allows you to bring
down your costs on hiring, training, and providing benefits to new employees, along with the administrative costs of the human resources department. It also lets you give a
respite to your permanent staff who may be overloaded during busy periods.</p>

<h4>REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN</h4><br></br>

<p>There are umpteen laws that organisations have to comply with in India - minimum wages, gratuity, ESIC, PF etc. just to name a few. Seven Consultancy Consulting takes
over the burden of all administrative tasks by acting as the central point for all temporary staffing requirements including labour law compliance and other legal issues. We
have a team of legal eagles and compliance officers to ensure that your business will be in 100% compliance with all the statutory regulations in the market.</P>

<h5>EMPLOYEE LEASING AND CONTRACT STAFFING</h5>

<p>Our Employee Leasing Service works by simply transferring employees from a company on to the payroll of Seven Consultancy's employee leasing services, and then
releasing them back to the company on a temporary basis. This facilitates Seven Consultancy to become the legal employer, thus taking over all your HR administrative and
management hassles.</P>

<p>When you outsource your HR administration to us, it will give you more time to focus on your core business, while saving you money, time, and resources. We have a huge,
multidisciplinary selection of temporary staff including attorneys, qualified accountants, insurance experts, and other professionals. No matter what kind of personnel you're
looking for, or for what duration, we can find the right people for you.</p>

<p>Contract labour has been in existence for a long time, but now it is becoming more prominent even in white-collar jobs. Contract staffing is advantageous for both businesses
and employees. Organisations have the flexibility of finding people for short projects, while talented employees also get to chart out a clear career path by progressively
handling more challenging and higher positions in different companies. Approach us when you need people for a short duration, a specific project, or to tide over your
seasonal staffing requirements.</p>

<p>We are one of the Top Reputed HR Consultancy in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai & Thane to provide Third Party Payroll. We are helping many SME’s and big corporates to take
employees in our payroll to reduce their overheads. They are getting employees as per their needs & timing. It is reducing their Recruitment Process cost as well as getting
the work done for overloaded projects.</P>

<p>We are providing complete solution for Third Party Payroll. Even organizations need not to hire additional Recruitment Consultancy or Placement Consultancy.
